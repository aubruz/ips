# IPS (Indoor Positioning System)
Android app to determine the indoor position through triangulation
This app was created as a proof of concept during my master thesis.

I decided to make it open-source to help other people achieve the
same goal.

This project has two parts :
1) The server side developed in PHP
2) The android app

## GOAL
The goal was to create an indoor positioning system with bluetooth,
wifi and terrestrial magnetic field and then see how accurate it
could be.

## How it works
1) Upload a map of the area used by the IPS on a server
2) Make fingerprints of designated spots
3) The system can now locate you

## TODO's
There are a lot of things to do. I wil list them as soon as I get
time to do it.

The first thing that I see would be to translate the app in English.
